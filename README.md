I'm just learning Javascript, so this is one of my first projects.  Very simple local weather based off your geolocation or zip code using the Wunderground API.  If you are using Chrome, you'll have to enter in a zipcode.  Chrome has put the cabash on geolocation from anything that isn't a secure site (https).
