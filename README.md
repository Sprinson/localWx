# localWx

I'm just learning Javascript, so this is one of my first projects.  Very simple local weather based off your geolocation using the Wunderground API.

You just need to make sure your browser is set to track your location.  It will not work if you're running it on your local machine in Chrome since Chrome will only do the whole geolocation thing if it's from a secure site. (https)
